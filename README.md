# MeteorShowerCalendar
 name is self explanatory

once upon a time, when I was an Android user, there was an app called Meteor Shower Calendar, me as amateur astronomer finds it helpful to set notification for next meteor shower to come, to catch it with my dslr. But now ist's not working anymore. And thought - I'm gonna create my own.
