# MeteorShowerCalendar
 name is self explanatory

once upon a time, there was an app called Meteor Shower Calendar, me as amateur astronomer finds it helpful to set notification for next meteor shower to come, to catch it with my dslr. But now ist's not working anymore. And I thought - hey, I can try to build my own one.


So, first of all - there will be a database for all meteor showers, no fancy APIs that some day will cease to exist, second - as an idea is to separate showers on Nothern Hemispere visibility and Sounthern, and third is to add sync with calendar or from-app notification, or even both. I wish me luck, cause I'm new in dev.
